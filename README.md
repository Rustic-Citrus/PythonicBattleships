# Pythonic Battleships

## Introduction

There are many ways to play Battleships. There's the classic game done on a grid, there are websites, and you can even buy it on Steam. Now, there is a way to play it with Python.

It is not perfect, and I am still ironing out the bugs, but in its current state, it works. More or less.


## Dependencies

I used a variety of modules in Python to make this work. Here is a complete list:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)
- [Pyglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyglet/)
- [Pydub](https://pypi.org/project/pydub/)
- pathlib (built-in module)
- string (built-in module)
- random (built-in module)
- warnings (built-in module)

## Issues

Under the Issues tab on the GitHub repository page, I've added some of the bugs that I've come across from my own testing. When I resolve them, I'll update the page.

If you encounter any bugs when you are playing, I encourage you to add them to Issues as well.

## Future Developments

One thing that I'd like to add is the possibility of multiple difficulties. For example, "Hard" difficulty would have a strong strategy based on previous moves, whereas an "Easy" difficulty would be similar to the current mode, where the computer fires randomly.
